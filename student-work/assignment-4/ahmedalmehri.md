I like python, because it's simple and I have the most experience with it.

## Example code 


''' 
def len_diff(s1, s2):
    if len(s1) >= len(s2):
       return len(s1) - len(s2)
    else:
       return len(s2) - len(s1)
'''

### This code is from CS111, a class I took exactly 3 years ago. It returns the difference in lengths of two strings.
